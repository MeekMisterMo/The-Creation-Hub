    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> 2 large 'Eggland's Best' eggs.</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons of milk.</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cooked broccoli florets,chopped.</li>
      <li>2 spoons of crumbled feta cheese.</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sun-dried tomatoes (chopped).</li>
      <li> 1/2 teaspoon of dried oregano.</li>
      <li> Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon of olive or butter.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li> In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, oregano, salt, and pepper until well combined. </li>
      <li> Heat olive oil or butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. </li>
      <li> Pour the egg mixture into the skillet, tilting it to spread evenly. Let it cook undisturbed for about 1-2 minutes or until the edges start to set. </li>
      <li> When the omelet is about 75% set but still slightly wet on top, carefully distribute your pre-cooked broccoli florets, crumbled feta cheese, and chopped sun-dried tomatoes over one half of the omelette. </li>
      <li> Using a spatula, gently fold the omelet in half to cover the fillings. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the cheese melts and the omelet is cooked through. </li>
      <li> Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve hot. Pair it with a slice of whole-grain toast or a side salad for a complete meal! </li>
    </ol>
